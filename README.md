# 🧠 SynapSys Reading Group
Welcome! This is an academic reading group, focused on high-quality discussion of research papers in:
 
- Distributed Systems
- LLM Inference & Fine-tuning
- Cloud Computing
- AI (with a systems perspective)

We meet regularly to read, analyze, and discuss research papers, share insights, and gradually build a global research community.
Sessions may be recorded and, in the future, published publicly (e.g., YouTube).

Our goal is to bridge **theory ↔ practice**, with an emphasis on:
- Scalable ML & LLM systems
- Distributed Systems
- Real-world deployment considerations

Whether you’re a PhD student, researcher, or practitioner, you’re very welcome here — as long as you engage respectfully and constructively.
